# Credit Management Migration Complete ✅

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved**
**Problem**: Credits were not properly stored in SwiftData - they were using in-memory storage via StoreKitManager, causing inconsistencies and loss of credit data.

**Solution**: Migrated all credit management to use SwiftData-backed PurchaseDataManager for persistent storage.

## 🔄 **Migration Changes**

### **1. StoreKitManager Credit Delegation**
- Updated `hasAvailableCredits()` to delegate to PurchaseDataManager
- Updated `hasAvailableCredits(for:)` to use SwiftData system for production companies
- Deprecated `useInvoiceCredit()` with backward compatibility

### **2. Removed StoreKitManager References**
**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `ProfileView.swift` - Removed all commented StoreKitManager references
- ✅ `InvoicesListView.swift` - Cleaned up environmentObject references  
- ✅ `InvoicesView.swift` - Removed StoreKitManager dependencies
- ✅ `AddInvoiceView.swift` - Re-enabled CreditsStatusView with SwiftData system
- ✅ `CompanyInAppPurchaseView.swift` - Updated sync logic to use SwiftData

### **3. Credit Flow Now Unified**
```swift
// OLD (Inconsistent): 
StoreKitManager.userCredits.availableInvoices  // In-memory
Company.availableInvoiceCredits               // SwiftData

// NEW (Unified):
PurchaseDataManager.shared.userProfile?.availableInvoices  // SwiftData
N1COEpayService.shared.userCredits.availableInvoices       // Computed from SwiftData
```

## 📊 **Credit Consumption Logic**

### **✅ Correct Flow:**
1. **Invoice Creation**: No credit consumed (draft only)
2. **Before Sync**: `validateCreditsBeforeSync()` checks available credits
3. **After Successful Sync**: `consumeCreditForCompletedInvoice()` decrements 1 credit
4. **Credit Storage**: Persisted in SwiftData `UserPurchaseProfile` model

### **🎯 Key Features:**
- ✅ **Persistent Storage**: All credits stored in SwiftData (survives app restarts)
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth**: PurchaseDataManager is the authoritative credit source
- ✅ **Consumption Tracking**: Each invoice consumption tracked with ID and timestamp
- ✅ **Test Account Exemption**: Test companies don't consume credits
- ✅ **CloudKit Sync**: Credit data syncs across user devices

## 🏗️ **SwiftData Models Used**

### **UserPurchaseProfile** 
```swift
@Model class UserPurchaseProfile {
    var availableInvoices: Int
    var totalPurchasedInvoices: Int
    var hasActiveSubscription: Bool
    var subscriptionExpiryDate: Date?
    // ... other fields
}
```

### **InvoiceConsumption**
```swift
@Model class InvoiceConsumption {
    var invoiceId: String
    var consumedDate: Date
    var isFromSubscription: Bool
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **Credit Validation:**
- ✅ Credits properly persist between app sessions
- ✅ Credits only consumed after successful invoice sync
- ✅ Test companies exempt from credit consumption
- ✅ UI shows accurate credit counts from SwiftData
- ✅ No double consumption issues

### **Migration Safety:**
- ✅ Automatic migration from UserDefaults to SwiftData
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ No data loss during transition
- ✅ Legacy StoreKitManager methods still work (delegated)

## 🎉 **Benefits Achieved**

1. **🔒 Data Persistence**: Credits no longer lost on app restart
2. **🔄 CloudKit Sync**: Credit data syncs across user devices  
3. **📊 Accurate Tracking**: Each invoice consumption properly recorded
4. **🎯 Consistent Logic**: Single credit validation throughout app
5. **🧪 Test Safety**: Test accounts protected from credit consumption
6. **📈 Scalability**: SwiftData models support future credit features

## 📝 **User Request Fulfilled**

> "1 credit should be consumed only when the invoice is synchronized and completed"

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Credits are now consumed only after successful invoice sync, with proper SwiftData persistence and tracking.

The credit management system is now robust, consistent, and properly persisted! 🎯
