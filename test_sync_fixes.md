# CloudKit Sync Fixes - Testing Checklist

## Summary of Fixes Applied

✅ **Fixed customer sync status setup**: Customers are now correctly marked with `shouldSyncToCloudKit=true` when created for production companies.

✅ **Fixed company conversion sync**: When companies are converted from test to production, customer sync status is now updated automatically.

✅ **Enhanced initial sync**: Customer sync status is updated during initial CloudKit sync to ensure all production company customers are marked for sync.

✅ **Added sync repair tools**: New "Fix Sync Status" button in CloudKit settings and comprehensive diagnostics tool.

## Testing Steps to Verify Fixes

### 1. Test Customer Creation for Production Company
1. Open the app in the simulator
2. Ensure you have a production company selected (not test)
3. Navigate to Customers section
4. Create a new customer
5. **Expected Result**: Customer should be automatically marked with `shouldSyncToCloudKit=true`

### 2. Test Company Conversion (if applicable)
1. If you have a test company, convert it to production
2. Navigate to CloudKit Settings → Diagnostics
3. Run the new SyncDiagnosticTool
4. **Expected Result**: All customers for the converted company should now be marked for sync

### 3. Test Sync Repair Function
1. Navigate to Account/Profile → CloudKit Settings
2. Tap "Diagnósticos" to open diagnostics
3. Use the new SyncDiagnosticTool to check current sync status
4. Tap "Corregir Estado de Sincronización" (Fix Sync Status)
5. **Expected Result**: Any customers not properly marked for sync should be corrected

### 4. Verify CloudKit Sync Status
1. Go to CloudKit Settings
2. Check the sync status indicators
3. **Expected Result**: Should show proper sync status for customers and invoices

## Verification Points

✅ Build succeeds without errors
✅ App launches successfully in simulator  
✅ All sync-related functionality compiles correctly
✅ New diagnostic tools are accessible in the UI

## Next Steps for User Testing

1. **Test with real data**: Create actual customers and invoices to verify sync behavior
2. **Monitor CloudKit dashboard**: Check if data appears correctly in CloudKit console
3. **Test across devices**: Verify sync works between multiple devices
4. **Test edge cases**: Test company conversion and sync repair scenarios

## Troubleshooting

If sync issues persist:
1. Use the new SyncDiagnosticTool to identify specific problems
2. Use the "Fix Sync Status" button to repair sync configurations
3. Check CloudKit settings and permissions
4. Review CloudKit quota and limits in the developer console

The fixes address the root cause identified: customers not being properly marked for CloudKit sync, especially after company type changes or during initial setup.
