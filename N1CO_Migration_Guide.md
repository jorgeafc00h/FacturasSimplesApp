- Enhanced with subscription management capabilities

**3. CreditCardInputView (`CreditCardInputView.swift`)**
- Beautiful, native SwiftUI credit card form
- Real-time validation and formatting
- 3DS authentication support via WebView
- Secure payment processing

**4. Updated InAppPurchaseView**
- Preserves original UI design and colors
- Integrates seamlessly with N1CO payment flow

### N1CO API Integration

#### Core Features Implemented:
- âœ… **Authentication**: Bearer token management with auto-refresh
- âœ… **Payment Methods**: Credit card tokenization and secure storage
- âœ… **One-time Payments**: Consumable products and implementation fees
- âœ… **Subscriptions**: Monthly/yearly recurring billing
- âœ… **3DS Authentication**: Enhanced security for credit card transactions

#### API Endpoints Used:
```
POST /token - Authentication
POST /paymentmethods - Credit card tokenization
POST /charges - One-time payments
POST /api/v2/Plans - Subscription plan creation
POST /api/v2/Subscriptions - User subscription management
```

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Configure N1CO Credentials
Update `N1COConfiguration.swift` with your actual credentials:
```swift

static let clientSecret = "your_actual_n1co_client_secret"
static let locationId = your_location_id
static let locationCode = "your_location_code"
```

#### 2. Test the Implementation
1. Open `InAppPurchaseView` in your app
2. Select a product (start with consumables for testing)
3. Fill in the credit card form with test data
4. Complete the purchase flow

#### 3. Production Checklist
- [ ] Update `N1COConfiguration.isProduction = true`
- [ ] Replace sandbox credentials with production credentials
